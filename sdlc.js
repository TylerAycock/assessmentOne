// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let analysisOfRequirements = `In this step the team is determining which language to write the software in and how best to format it. `
let design = `This step is your "drawing board" where you start on paper and work to coding implementation. Typically where you will see wireframing implemented`
let implementation = `In this step we are inputing the design we created into the software we have determined is best for the customers product`
let testingAndIntegration = `As beginners this should be happening simultaneously with the implementation process. For this step we are integrating the different components of the software app together  and testing to see if everything is working.`
let maintain = `In this step we are changing, modifying and updating the software to keep up with the customers needs and changing requirements`
